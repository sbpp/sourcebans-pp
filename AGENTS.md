# SourceBans++ — agent guide

Conventions and workflow for AI agents and human contributors. Read
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) first if you need a tour of the
codebase; this file is the cheatsheet.

## Stack at a glance

- `web/` — PHP 8.2 panel (Smarty 5, PDO/MariaDB, vanilla JS). Entry:
  `web/index.php` (pages) and `web/api.php` (JSON API).
- `game/addons/sourcemod/` — SourceMod plugin sources (`.sp`).
- `docker/` + `docker-compose.yml` + `sbpp.sh` — local dev stack.
- `web/install/` — legacy installer wizard. **Don't extend it.** Dev
  seeds the DB out of band; the wizard stays for production users.

## Keep the docs in sync

The docs are part of the codebase. Update them in the same PR as the
code change — never as a follow-up. CI doesn't gate this; it's on you.

| When you …                                                  | Update                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Add/rename/remove a top-level subsystem in `web/includes/`  | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Web panel → Directory layout, and the relevant subsystem section) |
| Change a request lifecycle (page or JSON API)               | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the lifecycle section + any diagrams) |
| Add an API handler **topic file** (new file in `api/handlers/`) | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (handler list under "Handler registration") |
| Add or rename a DB table, or change the schema substantively | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Database schema table) + ensure `install/includes/sql/struc.sql` is the source of truth + paired `web/updater/data/<N>.php` registered in `store.json` |
| Add or change a row in `install/includes/sql/data.sql` (e.g. new `sb_settings` key) | Paired migration in `web/updater/data/<N>.php` + register in `web/updater/store.json` (see "Updater migrations") |
| Add or remove a quality gate / CI workflow                  | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Quality gates) **and** `AGENTS.md` (Quality gates) |
| Change a `./sbpp.sh` command surface                        | `AGENTS.md` (Dev commands) + `docker/README.md`       |
| Introduce a new convention or pattern (e.g. View DTOs)      | `AGENTS.md` (Conventions) + `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it's an architectural shift |
| Remove a legacy pattern                                     | `AGENTS.md` (Anti-patterns) + `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Legacy patterns being phased out) |
| Change auth, CSRF, or permissions semantics                 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the relevant subsystem) + `AGENTS.md` (Conventions) if the rule changes |
| Add a new permission flag                                   | `web/configs/permissions/web.json`, regen API contract; doc only if the **role** of the flag affects conventions |
| Change the local dev stack (Docker, db-init, env vars)      | `docker/README.md` first, link from `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it changes the dev mental model |
| Edit user-facing install/quickstart                         | `README.md`                                           |

Quick rules:

- If you removed a file or renamed a directory, grep both docs for the
  old path and update the references.
- If a rule in this file no longer matches the code, the rule is wrong
  — fix the rule (or delete it) in the same PR as the code change.
- Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` descriptive ("how it works") and `AGENTS.md`
  prescriptive ("what to do / not do"). When in doubt, the actionable
  one-liner goes here; the explanation goes there.
- The "Where to find what" table at the bottom is the cheap index — add
  a row whenever you create a new file an agent might need to locate.

## Dev commands (`./sbpp.sh`)

Run from the repo root. All commands are idempotent.

```sh
./sbpp.sh up                       # build + start (panel at :8080, admin/admin)
./sbpp.sh down                     # stop, keep volumes
./sbpp.sh reset                    # stop + drop ALL volumes
./sbpp.sh status                   # ps
./sbpp.sh logs [svc]               # tail (svc: web|db|adminer|mailpit)
./sbpp.sh shell [svc]              # bash in svc (default web; svc=db opens mysql)
./sbpp.sh mysql                    # mariadb client on the dev DB
./sbpp.sh composer <cmd>           # composer in the web container
./sbpp.sh exec <cmd...>            # arbitrary command in the web container

# Quality gates (mirror CI exactly)
./sbpp.sh phpstan [args]           # static analysis (level 5 + dba)
./sbpp.sh test [args]              # PHPUnit on sourcebans_test DB
./sbpp.sh ts-check                 # tsc --checkJs over web/scripts
./sbpp.sh composer api-contract    # regen scripts/api-contract.js
./sbpp.sh e2e [args]               # Playwright E2E suite (lazy npm install + chromium browser)
./sbpp.sh upgrade-e2e [args]       # 1.x -> 2.0 upgrade harness (#1269) — separate
                                   # DB lifecycle (sourcebans_upgrade_*); not yet in CI.
                                   # Stages fixtures/upgrade/<v>.sql.gz; pins --project=chromium;
                                   # restores web/config.php on EXIT/INT/TERM.

# DB
./sbpp.sh db-dump [file]           # mysqldump to host
./sbpp.sh db-load <file>           # pipe a dump into the dev DB
./sbpp.sh db-reset                 # drop the DB volume + re-seed
./sbpp.sh db-seed [args]           # populate dev DB with realistic synthetic data
                                   # --scale=small|medium|large (default medium),
                                   # --seed=<int> (default pinned in code, deterministic).
                                   # Re-login required after each run (login_tokens truncated).
./sbpp.sh rebuild                  # --no-cache rebuild of the web image
```

URLs after `up`: panel `http://localhost:8080` (admin/admin), Adminer
`:8081`, Mailpit `:8025`, MariaDB exposed on host `:3307`.

The web container bind-mounts `./web`, so PHP edits land on the next
request — no restart. Restart only when:

- `composer.json` changed → `./sbpp.sh composer install`
- anything in `docker/` changed → `./sbpp.sh rebuild`

## Parallel stacks (subagents / multiple worktrees)

`docker-compose.yml` ships hardcoded `container_name`s (`sbpp-web`,
`sbpp-db`, `sbpp-adminer`, `sbpp-mailpit`) and lets `docker compose`
derive the project name from the cwd basename. Every worktree of this
repo has the same basename (`sourcebans-pp`), so two `./sbpp.sh up`
invocations from different worktrees collide on **container names** (Docker
rejects the second one), **host ports** (default `8080` / `8081` / `8025`
/ `1025` / `3307`), **and the project's named volumes** (`dbdata`,
`vendor`, `cache`, `smarty`) — they'd silently share/corrupt each
other's DB state.

If you're a subagent (or a human) running in a worktree alongside another
stack, drop a worktree-local `docker-compose.override.yml` that scopes
the project name, container names, and host ports to this worktree.
`docker compose` auto-loads it on top of `docker-compose.yml` and the
file is gitignored so it never sneaks into a PR:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml — parallel-stack scaffolding for this worktree.
name: sbpp-task-1109                # unique project name → unique volumes/network

services:
  web:
    container_name: sbpp-1109-web
    ports: !override
      - "${SBPP_WEB_PORT:-8189}:80"
  db:
    container_name: sbpp-1109-db
    ports: !override
      - "${SBPP_DB_PORT:-3416}:3306"
  adminer:
    container_name: sbpp-1109-adminer
    ports: !override
      - "${SBPP_ADMINER_PORT:-9189}:8080"
  mailpit:
    container_name: sbpp-1109-mailpit
    ports: !override
      - "${SBPP_MAILPIT_UI_PORT:-10189}:8025"
      - "${SBPP_MAILPIT_SMTP_PORT:-1134}:1025"
```

- The suffix (`1109` here) and host-port offsets are arbitrary — pick
  a free range tied to the issue/PR/task you're working on so two
  parallel agents don't collide on each other's overrides either.
- `./sbpp.sh up` / `phpstan` / `test` / `mysql` continue to work
  unchanged; `sbpp.sh` shells out to `docker compose` which composes
  both YAMLs.
- **Tear down before deleting the worktree.** `./sbpp.sh down` (or
  `reset`) removes the named containers/volumes; otherwise they leak
  and you'll discover orphan `sbpp-task-*_dbdata` volumes weeks later.

## Quality gates

CI runs five gates on every PR. Match them locally before opening one.

| Gate           | Local                                | CI workflow            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| PHPStan        | `./sbpp.sh phpstan`                  | `phpstan.yml`          |
| PHPUnit        | `./sbpp.sh test`                     | `test.yml`             |
| ts-check       | `./sbpp.sh ts-check`                 | `ts-check.yml`         |
| API contract   | `./sbpp.sh composer api-contract`    | `api-contract.yml`     |
| Playwright E2E | `./sbpp.sh e2e`                      | `e2e.yml`              |

PHPStan specifics:

- Level 5 (bumped from 4 in #1101). Raise one step at a time; never
  jump 5 → 7 in one PR.
- Baseline at `web/phpstan-baseline.neon`. Regenerate **only** when a
  real fix removes an entry or when bumping the level:

  ```sh
  ./sbpp.sh phpstan --generate-baseline=phpstan-baseline.neon
  ```

- `staabm/phpstan-dba` introspects the live MariaDB to type-check raw
  SQL. Set `PHPSTAN_DBA_DISABLE=1` to skip when working offline; CI
  sets `DBA_REQUIRE=1` so credential drift fails loudly.

PHPUnit specifics:

- Tests run against a dedicated `sourcebans_test` DB so they never
  stomp dev data.

  ```sh
  ./sbpp.sh test --filter=SomeTest
  ./sbpp.sh test tests/api/AccountTest.php
  ```

- API contract snapshots live under `web/tests/api/__snapshots__/`. CI
  asserts byte-for-byte. When you intentionally change a handler's wire
  format, regenerate them in the same PR:

  ```sh
  UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 ./sbpp.sh test
  ```

- The action-to-permission matrix is locked in
  `web/tests/api/PermissionMatrixTest.php`. **Adding or renaming an
  action in `_register.php` requires a matching row there** — the
  cross-check fails the build otherwise. Use `Api::actions()` if you
  ever need to enumerate the live registry from another test.

ts-check specifics:

- Runs `tsc --noEmit --checkJs` against the `.js` files in place using
  `// @ts-check` + JSDoc. No `.ts` sources, no bundler. `npm install`
  inside the container is lazy on first run; `web/node_modules/` never
  ships.

API-contract specifics:

- `web/scripts/api-contract.js` is a checked-in source file (like a
  lockfile), not a build artifact. Release tarballs ship it; self-hosters
  need no codegen step.
- CI fails on `git diff` after regeneration. Always commit the
  regenerated file in the same PR as the PHP change.

Playwright E2E specifics:

- Suite location: `web/tests/e2e/` with its own `package.json`
  (separate from PHPUnit; PHPUnit owns `web/composer.json` /
  `web/package.json`).
- DB: `sourcebans_e2e` (parallel to `sourcebans_test`). Reset between
  specs via `truncateE2eDb()` (truncate + re-seed); full
  install only on global setup. The shim
  `web/tests/e2e/scripts/reset-e2e-db.php` reuses
  `Sbpp\Tests\Fixture` so the fixture stays single-source.
- Cross-process resets are serialized via a MySQL named lock in
  `Sbpp\Tests\Fixture::truncateAndReseed` (per-DB scope, 30s timeout).
  `reset-e2e-db.php` runs in a fresh PHP process per spec, so the
  truncate→seed pair has to be atomic across processes — without the
  lock two callers can race and the second hits
  `1062 Duplicate entry '0' for key 'PRIMARY'`. Don't reach around it.
- CI runs **`workers: 1`**. The suite shares one DB (`sourcebans_e2e`),
  and even with the truncate-and-reseed lock above making *resets*
  atomic, two workers running simultaneously means worker B's reset
  can wipe table state out from under worker A's in-flight test
  (missing rows → 404, missing admin row during a reseed window →
  `forbidden / No access`, etc.). Until each worker has its own DB,
  parallelism here is unsound. Don't bump `workers` back up without
  shipping per-worker DB isolation.
- Flake tolerance is **off**: `retries: 1` in CI **plus**
  `failOnFlakyTests: true`. A spec that fails first try and passes on
  retry counts as a real failure — the retry exists so
  `trace: 'on-first-retry'` produces diagnostic artifacts, not as a
  release valve. If a real flake creeps in, fix the underlying race
  (the truncate-and-reseed lock and `workers: 1` above are the
  canonical examples) instead of weakening the gate.
- Auth: storage state minted once per run by
  `fixtures/global-setup.ts` against the seeded `admin/admin` user.
  The login spec is the **one** exception that drives the form
  itself — every other spec inherits the storage state.
- Selectors must use #1123's testability hooks (`data-testid`,
  `[data-active]`, `[data-loading]`, `[data-skeleton]`, ARIA roles,
  `<html class="dark">` for resolved theme). Never CSS class chains;
  never visible text as the *primary* selector. `hasText` filters
  are fine to disambiguate when the primary selector matches more
  than one node (e.g. multiple toasts).
- axe (`@axe-core/playwright`) threshold is **critical**. Use
  `expectNoCriticalA11y(page, testInfo)` from `fixtures/axe.ts`;
  do NOT downgrade the threshold to make tests green — file a
  follow-up against the underlying #1123 testability patterns.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set globally via
  `playwright.config.ts`. Animations should never gate visibility;
  if a test needs a `setTimeout`, the chrome's missing a terminal
  attribute (see `_base.ts`). The CSS side honours the same media
  query — `theme.css` carries a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
  reduce)` global rule that collapses every `animation-duration` /
  `transition-duration` to ~0ms (#1207). Without that guard the
  drawer's `slide-in` keyframe would still run for 250ms inside
  the test browser and a `boundingBox()` read right after
  `[data-drawer-open="true"]` settles can land mid-translateX,
  off the viewport. Don't gate animations on JS state machines;
  let the CSS guard handle it.
- `./sbpp.sh e2e --grep @screenshot SCREENSHOTS=1` produces the
  per-PR screenshot gallery. The
  `web/tests/e2e/scripts/upload-screenshots.sh` wrapper pushes the
  PNGs to the `screenshots-archive` orphan branch under a per-PR
  subdirectory and prints the markdown table to comment on the PR.

## Conventions

### Database

- Access goes through `web/includes/Database.php` (PDO).
- Tables use `:prefix_` literals (`SELECT … FROM \`:prefix_admins\``);
  `Database::query()` rewrites the placeholder. Never inline the prefix.
- Pattern: `query` → `bind` → `execute` / `single` / `resultset`.
- ADOdb was fully removed (commit `b9c812b2`). **Do not reintroduce it.**

### Null-into-scalar discipline (PHP 8.2+)

`web/composer.json` requires `php >= 8.2`, so PHP's
"`Deprecated: <fn>(): Passing null to parameter #1 of type string`"
surface is active. PHP 9 will turn it into a `TypeError`. Every
`strlen` / `trim` / `substr` / `preg_match` / `mb_strlen` / etc.
call against a value that can be `null` at runtime needs one of
two idiomatic shapes (#1273):

- **Coalesce** when null is semantically "absent" — e.g. a `$_POST`
  / `$_GET` / `$_SESSION` / `$_SERVER` lookup the form may have
  omitted:

  ```php
  if (strlen($_POST['password'] ?? '') < MIN_PASS_LENGTH) { … }
  $name = trim((string) ($_POST['name'] ?? ''));
  ```

- **Cast** when the value should always be a string but the type
  system can't see it (most often a nullable `:prefix_*` row column,
  or a `mixed`-returning helper like `CUserManager::GetProperty`):

  ```php
  if (strlen((string) $row['ban_ip']) < 7) { … }
  $steam = trim((string) $userbank->GetProperty('authid', $aid));
  ```

- Never `if (!is_null($x) && strlen($x) > 0)` — verbose and the
  conditional reads worse than the coalesce.
- `phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules` + `phpVersion: 80200` is the
  static gate; `Php82DeprecationsTest` (PHPUnit) is the runtime gate
  for the bits PHPStan doesn't see (excluded paths like
  `includes/auth/openid.php`, runtime values that look non-null to
  the type system but actually aren't).
- `web/includes/auth/openid.php` is excluded from PHPStan and is
  third-party-shaped: cast at function inputs (entry points) so the
  diff stays bounded; never sprinkle `(string)` at every internal
  call.
- Replacing nullable `:prefix_*` columns with `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`
  would also clear the deprecation, but it's a paired schema
  migration with a separate semantic change ("no IP" vs "empty IP")
  — file separately, not as part of a deprecation sweep.

### Dev DB seeder (`./sbpp.sh db-seed`)

`./sbpp.sh db-seed` populates the dev DB (`sourcebans`) with a deterministic,
realistic synthetic dataset across bans, comms, servers, admins, groups,
submissions, protests, comments, notes, banlog, and the audit log. Use it
when you need the panel surfaces (banlist, dashboard, drawer, moderation
queues, audit log) to render with real-looking data instead of empty
states. Acceptance audits and screenshot work both depend on it.

- Lives at `web/tests/Synthesizer.php` (`Sbpp\Tests\Synthesizer`); CLI
  driver at `web/tests/scripts/seed-dev-db.php`. Both are dev-only —
  the synthesizer refuses any `DB_NAME` other than `sourcebans`, so
  `sourcebans_test` / `sourcebans_e2e` stay untouched and the E2E
  suite (which builds its own rows per spec) is unaffected.
- Idempotent: every run truncates the synth-owned tables first
  (preserving `sb_settings` / `sb_mods` from `data.sql`), re-seeds the
  CONSOLE + `admin/admin` rows, then inserts the synthetic dataset.
- Deterministic given a fixed `--seed` — `mt_srand($seed)` pins PHP's
  RNG so two devs hit the same names/reasons/timestamps. Default seed
  is `Synthesizer::DEFAULT_SEED` (pinned in code).
- Three tiers: `--scale=small` (~30 bans, fast iteration), `medium`
  (default, ~200 bans), `large` (~2000 bans for pagination / perf).
- Do NOT reach for this from `Fixture::truncateAndReseed()` (the e2e
  hot path) — those two diverge by design. The synthesizer is for
  manual dev / screenshot work; the e2e fixture stays minimal so each
  spec controls what rows it needs.
- Anti-pattern: extending `data.sql` with synthetic rows (it's the
  fresh-install seed and would force a paired updater migration for
  every change) or shipping the seeder in a release tarball (the
  refusal guard is the safety mechanism; see `seed-dev-db.php`'s
  docblock for the full risk model).

### Updater migrations

Every change to `web/install/includes/sql/data.sql` (new `sb_settings` row,
new seed) **and** every schema change in `struc.sql` needs a paired
migration in `web/updater/data/<N>.php`, registered in
`web/updater/store.json`. `data.sql` is consulted **only on fresh installs**;
the updater scripts are how existing panels catch up. Adding a row to
`data.sql` alone silently breaks every upgraded install — the two halves
of the diff ship together or not at all.

- Pick `<N>` as the next integer above the current max key in
  `store.json`. Numbers are historical, not semantic.
- Keep migrations **idempotent**: `INSERT IGNORE`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
  `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` guarded by an existence check. The runner
  has no rollback — re-running must be a no-op.
- Use the `:prefix_` placeholder. Never inline the prefix.
- Defaults in the migration must match the defaults in `data.sql` so
  fresh and upgraded installs converge to the same state.
- The script is `require_once`'d inside the `Updater` instance scope, so
  `$this->dbs` is in scope; PHPStan can't see this, so prefix each
  `$this->dbs` call with `// @phpstan-ignore variable.undefined`. See
  `web/updater/data/802.php` and `803.php` for the canonical shape.

### JSON API

- Endpoints live in `web/api/handlers/<topic>.php`, registered in
  `web/api/handlers/_register.php`.
- Each handler is a pure `function(array $params): array`.
- To surface a structured error, `throw new ApiError($code, $msg, $field?, $http?)`.
- To navigate, `return Api::redirect($url)`.
- The dispatcher enforces auth: any non-public action requires a
  logged-in user; declare additional checks via the `$perm` /
  `$requireAdmin` args of `Api::register()`.
- After editing a handler's name, perm mask, or `@param`/`@return`
  docblock, regenerate the contract:

  ```sh
  ./sbpp.sh composer api-contract
  ```

- **Do not** add new functions to `sb-callback.php` (removed) or reach
  for xajax (removed).

### CSRF

- Required on every state-changing form/JSON call.
- In templates: `{csrf_field}`. In page POST handlers:
  `CSRF::validate(...)` or `CSRF::rejectIfInvalid()` (the dispatcher
  also accepts the token via the `X-CSRF-Token` header — `sb.api.call`
  sets it automatically).

### Permissions

- Web flags live in `web/configs/permissions/web.json`; `init.php`
  defines each as a global PHP constant (`ADMIN_OWNER`, `ADMIN_ADD_BAN`, …).
- SourceMod char flags live in `web/configs/permissions/sourcemod.json`.
- `CUserManager::HasAccess(flags)` accepts either form;
  `Api::register()` forwards whichever was registered.
- In JS, reference perms as `Perms.ADMIN_*` from the autogenerated
  contract — never raw integers.

### Frontend (`web/scripts/`)

- Vanilla JS only — `// @ts-check` + JSDoc on every file.
- DOM helpers and the `sb` namespace live in `sb.js`. Use
  `sb.$idRequired(id)` when a missing element is a programmer error;
  `sb.$id(id)` returns `HTMLElement | null` and must be narrowed.
- For new code, prefer typed selectors
  (`document.querySelector<HTMLInputElement>(...)`) over `SbAnyEl`.
  `SbAnyEl` is intentionally permissive for legacy form-element access.
- API calls go through `sb.api.call(Actions.PascalName, params)` — never
  string literals.
- **Do not** reintroduce MooTools, React, or a runtime bundler.
  Self-hosters install by unzipping the release tarball.

### Templates + View DTOs

- Pages are rendered via typed view-model DTOs in `Sbpp\View\*`
  (`web/includes/View/`), not ad-hoc `$theme->assign(...)` chains.

  ```php
  use Sbpp\View\HomeDashboardView;
  use Sbpp\View\Renderer;

  Renderer::render($theme, new HomeDashboardView(
      dashboard_text: (string) Config::get('dash.intro.text'),
      // … every variable the template consumes …
  ));
  ```

- One View per `.tpl`, keyed by its `TEMPLATE` constant. Public readonly
  properties match the template's variables.
- The `SmartyTemplateRule` PHPStan rule (`web/includes/PHPStan/SmartyTemplateRule.php`)
  cross-checks each concrete view's properties against the template
  tree. Include-expanded templates (e.g. `page_dashboard.tpl` pulls in
  `page_servers.tpl`) need the outer view to declare the union of both
  templates' variables.
- Pages that render multiple templates build one View per template and
  call `Renderer::render` for each.
- Templates with non-default delimiters (currently `page_login.tpl`,
  `page_blockit.tpl`, `page_kickit.tpl`, and
  `page_admin_servers_rcon.tpl` using `-{ … }-`) override
  `View::DELIMITERS`. `page_youraccount.tpl` was on this list before
  #1123 B20 rewrote it in standard `{ }` delimiters; do NOT regress
  it back to `-{ … }-` without a paired edit here.

### Permission display surfaces

When a page surfaces the user's **own** permission flags back to them
(currently `page_youraccount.tpl`'s "Your permissions" card), do NOT
render a flat list of `BitToString()` output — group by category via
`Sbpp\View\PermissionCatalog::groupedDisplayFromMask($mask)` so the
section reads:

```
Bans            Servers
- Add Bans      - View Servers
- …             - …

Admins          Groups          Mods            Settings
…               …               …               …
```

The categories live in `PermissionCatalog::WEB_CATEGORIES` (Bans /
Servers / Admins / Groups / Mods / Settings / Owner — order matters,
it's the render order). Adding a new flag to
`web/configs/permissions/web.json` requires a paired addition to one
of these categories; `PermissionCatalogTest::testEveryAdminConstantBelongsToExactlyOneCategory`
fails the gate otherwise so a new flag isn't silently invisible on
the account page.

`Perms::for()` (the permission **gate** snapshot) and
`PermissionCatalog` (the permission **display** structure) are two
different surfaces — don't conflate them. `Perms::for` is what page
Views consume to gate `{if $can_add_ban}`; `PermissionCatalog` is
what the rare display-the-user's-flags-back-to-them surfaces consume.

### `nofilter` discipline

Smarty auto-escape is on globally (`$theme->setEscapeHtml(true)` in
`init.php`). `{$foo nofilter}` is the escape hatch. Every use is a load
bearing assertion that the value is already safe HTML, so:

- Each `{$foo nofilter}` (or `{$foo|nofilter}`) needs a Smarty comment
  immediately above it explaining **why** the value is safe to drop in
  raw. One-line format:

  ```smarty
  {* nofilter: <one-line reason — what built it, why no user input flows in unescaped> *}
  {$foo nofilter}
  ```

  A foreach block emitting many sibling `nofilter` items can share one
  annotation if the comment explicitly covers the block (e.g. `each
  *_link below is CreateLinkR-built …`).
- If you can't write a one-liner that's true, the value isn't safe —
  fix the upstream PHP (escape on store, or rebuild without `nofilter`)
  rather than papering over it. Admin-controlled display text that's
  meant to be rich rendering goes through `Sbpp\Markup\IntroRenderer`
  (CommonMark, `html_input: 'escape'`, `allow_unsafe_links: false`); see
  the `IntroRenderer` row in "Where to find what".

### Admin-authored display text (`Sbpp\Markup\IntroRenderer`)

- Anything an admin types in the panel that we render to other users
  (currently the dashboard `dash.intro.text` setting) goes through
  `Sbpp\Markup\IntroRenderer::renderIntroText()` before it reaches
  Smarty. The renderer wraps `league/commonmark` with
  `html_input: 'escape'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false`, so:
  - Inline HTML is rendered as visible escaped text, not parsed.
  - `javascript:` / `data:` / `vbscript:` URLs are stripped during
    rendering.
- Page handlers pass the **rendered HTML** into the View DTO and the
  template emits it with `nofilter`, with the canonical safety comment
  above the line (see `web/themes/default/page_dashboard.tpl` for the
  reference shape).
- Settings UIs surface a Markdown cheat-sheet link in the help icon.
  **Do not** reintroduce a WYSIWYG editor for these fields; the
  WYSIWYG was the source of #1113's stored-XSS vector.
- A live preview pane (textarea on the left, server-rendered HTML on
  the right) is the canonical UX. Updates POST the textarea value to
  the `system.preview_intro_text` JSON action, which pipes the value
  through the same `IntroRenderer` so the preview matches the public
  dashboard byte-for-byte. The first paint is server-rendered (so the
  page works without JS); the JS-side update only fires on input.
  Reuse this pattern — never call a third-party Markdown renderer
  client-side, as it would diverge from the safe-on-render contract.

### Page-level table of contents (dense admin pages)

Some admin routes (`admin-admins`, `admin-bans`, the audit pegged
`myaccount` for the same shape) cram several semi-related surfaces
onto one long scroll. The pattern locked in by #1207 ADM-3 (and
generalised in #1239) is a sticky page-level ToC: anchor sidebar at
`>=1024px`, accordion (`<details open>`) at `<1024px`, with each
section anchored via a unique `id="…"` + `scroll-margin-top: 4rem`
so jumps clear the sticky topbar (3.5rem).

The ToC chrome lives in the parameterized partial
`web/themes/default/page_toc.tpl`; both adopters (admin-admins and
admin-bans) `{include file="page_toc.tpl"}` it after assigning
`$toc_id`, `$toc_label`, and `$toc_entries`.

#1266 unified the visual chrome with Pattern A (`core/admin_sidebar.tpl`):
both surfaces sit in the same 14rem rail at the same breakpoint,
and end users perceive them as the same chrome element — the
pre-#1266 divergence (Pattern A: iconed pill rows + active-state
highlight; Pattern B: plain text rows, no icons, no highlight) read
as broken. The unified contract:

- The DOM emits **dual class names** on the aside / details / summary
  / nav elements (`admin-sidebar page-toc`, `admin-sidebar__details
  page-toc__details`, …). The bare CSS lives in `theme.css` under
  grouped `.admin-sidebar*, .page-toc*` selectors so chrome edits
  apply to both surfaces simultaneously and future drift is
  impossible. The legacy `.page-toc*` selectors keep matching for
  any third-party theme that styles by these names.
- Each entry is rendered as `<a class="sidebar__link admin-sidebar__link
  page-toc__link" data-toc-target="<slug>">` with a Lucide icon —
  same shape as Pattern A links — so the active-state CSS
  (`.sidebar__link[aria-current="page"]`) is single-source with the
  main app shell. Pre-#1266 the partial wrapped each link in `<ul><li>`;
  the new shape flattens to direct `<a>` children of `<nav>`.
- Active state is JS-driven by an inline `IntersectionObserver` in
  `page_toc.tpl` itself (vanilla `// @ts-check` JSDoc, no new deps).
  The first link is server-rendered with `aria-current="page"` so
  the page works without JS; the observer refines the active link
  as the user scrolls. The observer's `rootMargin: '-4rem 0px -50%
  0px'` matches the section `scroll-margin-top` so a section
  becomes "the active one" the moment its heading clears the
  sticky topbar.
- The routing semantics stay different (Pattern A navigates between
  sibling URLs; Pattern B scrolls within one page) but the visible
  chrome no longer diverges.

Per-page CSS that's still page-toc-specific (the cross-template
content-column anchors, the `.page-toc-shell` page-padding inset)
lives under `.page-toc-section` / `.page-toc-shell` / `.page-toc-content`
in `theme.css`. Per-link styling comes from the shared
`.sidebar__link.admin-sidebar__link` block.

`$toc_entries` is `list<{slug: string, label: string, icon: string}>`
— each entry **MUST** carry a Lucide `icon` name. Pre-#1266 the
field didn't exist; #1266 added it as required so every row has
matching visual weight. Pick icons consistent with the Pattern A
vocabulary already in `admin.servers.php` / `admin.groups.php` /
etc (`server`, `plus`, `users`, `puzzle`, `globe`, `package`,
`cog`, `image`, `flag`, `clipboard-list`, `search`, `user-plus`,
`shield`, `upload`). Entries fall back to `circle-dot` when the
field is missing so a partial migration never paints with no
icon, but new entries should always declare one.

Reference shapes:

- **admin-admins** (#1207 ADM-3 / #1266) — three templates wrap the
  cross-template `.page-toc-shell`. `page_admin_admins_list.tpl`
  opens the shell + includes `page_toc.tpl` + opens
  `.page-toc-content`; `page_admin_overrides.tpl` (the last template)
  closes both. The ToC payload is carried by `AdminAdminsListView`
  (the FIRST View rendered) — `toc_id`, `toc_label`, `toc_entries`.
  Each entry's `icon` is set in `web/pages/admin.admins.php`
  alongside the permission-gating block.
- **admin-bans** (#1239 / #1266) — five sections live inside the
  ToC shell; the page handler (`web/pages/admin.bans.php`) opens
  the shell + drives `page_toc.tpl` directly via `$theme->display(...)`
  then emits `<section id="…">` wrappers around each existing
  `Renderer::render(...)` call. Closing tags live at the bottom of
  the same handler. This shape is the right call when sections are
  already structured as PHP echo chunks (e.g. when a section like
  protests/submissions wraps multiple sibling Views with chip-row
  navigation between them).

Conventions for both shapes:

- The ToC partial is included **once** per route. Document the
  open/close pairing of `.page-toc-shell` / `.page-toc-content`
  with a Smarty (or HTML in PHP echos) comment at each end so edits
  don't silently break the layout.
- Each section gets `<section id="…" class="page-toc-section"
  data-testid="<page>-section-…" aria-labelledby="…-heading">` plus
  an `<h2 id="…-heading" class="page-toc-section__heading">` so
  screen-readers can navigate by landmark name. Reuse the
  `page-toc-section` class so all sections share the
  `scroll-margin-top` rule. The `id` attribute MUST match the ToC
  entry's `slug` — the `IntersectionObserver` looks up
  `document.getElementById(slug)` to drive active state.
- Permission gates on ToC entries mirror what the dispatcher would
  render anyway (e.g. `$can_add_admins` in `admin-admins`,
  `$canImport` / `$canGroupBan` in `admin-bans`); a ToC entry for a
  section the dispatcher wouldn't paint is a dead link.
- Selectors for E2E specs are `[data-testid="<page>-toc"]` (outer
  aside), `[data-testid="<page>-toc-link-<slug>"]` (per anchor),
  and `[data-testid="<page>-section-<slug>"]` (per section). The
  active link asserts via `[aria-current="page"]` — same selector
  as Pattern A. Never CSS class chains; never visible-text-as-primary.
  The desktop contract is "scrolls to the right section" — assert
  via `expect(section).toBeInViewport()` after the click, not
  against a fixed `boundingBox.y` because the **last** section can
  never reach the top of the viewport (no document below it).

When `myaccount` (or any other dense page) adopts this pattern,
reuse `page_toc.tpl` directly — it already takes `toc_id`,
`toc_label`, `toc_entries` (with icons) parameters scoped per page.
Add the new `data-testid="<page>-toc"` to the spec list above and
follow either the View-driven (admin-admins) or page-handler-driven
(admin-bans) shape depending on whether the page renders one View
or many.

### Sub-paged admin routes (`?section=…` routing)

Admin routes that subdivide into a small fixed set of unrelated
sub-tasks (servers / mods / groups / comms / settings) ride the
**`?section=<slug>` URL pattern** instead of stacking all panes in
one DOM. Each section is its own URL — linkable, back-button-friendly,
server-rendered, works without JS — and the page handler renders
exactly one View per request.

Reference: `web/pages/admin.settings.php` is the long-standing
canonical shape; #1239 brought servers / mods / groups / comms onto
the same convention; #1259 unified the chrome on the Settings-style
vertical sidebar partial `core/admin_sidebar.tpl`.

Page-handler shape:

```php
$canList = $userbank->HasAccess(ADMIN_OWNER | ADMIN_LIST_SERVERS);
$canAdd  = $userbank->HasAccess(ADMIN_OWNER | ADMIN_ADD_SERVER);

/** @var list<array{slug: string, name: string, permission: int, url: string, icon: string}> $sections */
$sections = [
    ['slug' => 'list', 'name' => 'List servers',   'permission' => …, 'url' => '?p=admin&c=servers&section=list', 'icon' => 'server'],
    ['slug' => 'add',  'name' => 'Add new server', 'permission' => …, 'url' => '?p=admin&c=servers&section=add',  'icon' => 'plus'],
];

$validSlugs = ['list', 'add'];
$section = (string) ($_GET['section'] ?? '');
if (!in_array($section, $validSlugs, true)) {
    $section = $canList ? 'list' : ($canAdd ? 'add' : 'list');
}

// AdminTabs opens the sidebar shell + emits the <aside> + opens the
// content column. The page handler is responsible for closing both
// wrappers AFTER the View renders — see the docblock on AdminTabs.php.
new AdminTabs($sections, $userbank, $theme, $section, 'Server sections');

if ($section === 'add') {
    Renderer::render($theme, new AdminServersAddView(...));
    echo '</div></div><!-- /.admin-sidebar-content + /.admin-sidebar-shell -->';
    return;
}
Renderer::render($theme, new AdminServersListView(...));
echo '</div></div><!-- /.admin-sidebar-content + /.admin-sidebar-shell -->';
```

Conventions:

- Default to the FIRST accessible section when `?section=` is
  missing or unknown — never render a blank body.
- Chrome is the parameterized vertical sidebar `core/admin_sidebar.tpl`
  (#1259). `AdminTabs.php` opens `<div class="admin-sidebar-shell">`,
  emits the `<aside>` + link list, then opens
  `<div class="admin-sidebar-content">` for the page View; the page
  handler **must** close both wrappers (`echo '</div></div>'`) AFTER
  the `Renderer::render(...)` call so each section nests correctly.
  Mirror the `page-toc-shell` pairing from Pattern B (#1239).
- Each link is an anchor (`<a href="?p=admin&c=…&section=…"
  data-testid="admin-tab-<slug>" aria-current="page">`), not a button.
  Pre-#1239 the strip emitted `<button onclick="openTab(...)">` which
  dispatched to a JS function in `sourcebans.js` (deleted at #1123
  D1) — clicks did nothing and every pane stacked together. Don't
  reintroduce the button shape.
- Each `$sections` entry carries an `icon` (Lucide name — `server`,
  `plus`, `users`, `puzzle`, `globe`, `package`, `cog`, `image`,
  `flag`, `clipboard-list`, …). When omitted, the partial renders a
  generic `circle-dot` so every row has matching visual weight.
  Pick icons that match the visual vocabulary already in the
  Settings sidebar (`page_admin_settings_*.tpl`).
- Each section's `slug` matches `?section=<slug>` AND the
  `data-testid="admin-tab-<slug>"` hook on the rendered link.
  E2E specs anchor on the testid + the active link's
  `aria-current="page"` attribute (see
  `web/tests/e2e/specs/responsive/admin-tabs.spec.ts` for the
  mobile accordion contract; the sidebar sits at the top of the
  content column at `<1024px` and floats next to it as a sticky
  14rem rail at `>=1024px`).
- Pass an aria-label as the fifth `AdminTabs` argument
  (`'Server sections'`, `'MOD sections'`, …); screen readers
  announce the navigation by this label. Defaults to "Page
  sections" when omitted.
- The `core/admin_tabs.tpl` partial still exists but is now
  exclusively the **back-link-only** shape for edit-* pages
  (`admin.edit.ban.php`, `admin.rcon.php`, …) which call
  `new AdminTabs([], $userbank, $theme)`. AdminTabs.php routes
  empty `$tabs` to that partial and non-empty `$tabs` to
  `core/admin_sidebar.tpl`. Don't reach for `core/admin_tabs.tpl`
  directly from new code.
- Use Pattern A (this section) when sub-tasks are unrelated and a
  small two-or-three-section split is enough. Use Pattern B
  (page-level ToC, above) when sub-tasks are *context for each
  other* and an admin needs to move between them in one session
  (admin-admins, admin-bans).
- Single-section "pages" that used to render a one-button AdminTabs
  strip (e.g. admin.comms.php's "Add a block" surface) drop the
  strip entirely — there's nothing to route to, so the surface is
  reachable from the parent list's CTA + the sidebar.

### Empty states (`first-run` vs `filtered`)

Empty surfaces follow one of two shapes; pick by whether the empty
result is structural (no rows exist anywhere) or filter-induced
(rows exist but the active filter excludes everything):

- **first-run** (no data exists): icon + short title ("No servers
  configured yet") + one-line body explaining what will appear here +
  a primary CTA gated on the appropriate `ADMIN_*` flag (e.g.
  `dashboard-recent-bans-empty-add`, `servers-empty-add`,
  `banlist-empty-add`, `comms-empty-add`). Mark the container with
  `data-filtered="false"`. Read-only streams (e.g. "Latest blocked
  attempts", admin submission/protest archives) get the same card
  layout but **no** CTA — there's no admin action that seeds them.
- **filtered** (data exists, filter excluded everything): icon +
  short title ("No bans match those filters") + one-line body + a
  secondary "Clear filters" CTA that drops the user back at the
  unfiltered route. Mark the container with `data-filtered="true"`.

Surfaces that mix the two (banlist, commslist, audit log) compute an
`$is_filtered` flag in the page handler from the active `_GET` /
session params and branch the entire empty-state block on it; the
View DTO carries the flag. See `page.banlist.php` /
`page.commslist.php` / `page_admin_audit.tpl` for the reference
shapes. Tests anchor on the `data-filtered` attribute (`[data-filtered="false"]`
for the first-run shape, `[data-filtered="true"]` for the filtered
shape) — never on visible copy.

Use the shared `.empty-state` / `.empty-state__icon` /
`.empty-state__title` / `.empty-state__body` /
`.empty-state__actions` classes from `web/themes/default/css/theme.css`
so the visual treatment stays consistent across surfaces. Never
inline an ad-hoc empty state — the unified pattern is what the
audit (#1207) locked in. New CTAs:

- Bind to a `data-testid` per surface (e.g.
  `dashboard-servers-empty-add`, `servers-empty-add`) so E2E specs
  anchor on the contract, not visible text.
- Live behind `{if $can_*}` (the `Sbpp\View\Perms::for($userbank)`
  snapshot) so a user without the relevant `ADMIN_*` flag sees the
  body copy without the link they couldn't follow.

### Upgrade harness (`web/tests/e2e/specs/upgrade/`)

Playwright sub-suite (#1269) that drives the v1.x → v2.0 upgrade
end-to-end against the snapshot fixtures from #1268 and asserts
schema parity, settings parity, idempotency of the updater, and a
post-upgrade login smoke flow. Different DB lifecycle from the rest
of the e2e suite — uses throwaway `sourcebans_upgrade_*` schemas
per spec, not the shared `sourcebans_e2e`. Wrapper:
`./sbpp.sh upgrade-e2e`.

- The PHP CLI driver (`_helpers/scripts/upgrade-db.php`) refuses
  any DB whose name doesn't start with `sourcebans_upgrade_` —
  same shape as the dev synthesizer's "refuse anything but
  `sourcebans`" guard. Don't reach around it; if you need a new
  throwaway DB, name it `sourcebans_upgrade_<slug>`.
- Each new fixture lives as a sibling spec
  (`upgrade-1.7.0.spec.ts`, `upgrade-1.8.4.spec.ts`, …). They share
  the helpers under `_helpers/` but each owns its own pair of
  throwaway DBs (one for the upgrade walk, one as the fresh-install
  reference for parity diffs) so a failure in one fixture's run
  doesn't leak state into another. Tag every spec `@upgrade` so
  the wrapper's default `--grep` pulls it in.
- The schema diff snapshot at `__snapshots__/<version>/schema.diff`
  is a **locked baseline**, not a "regenerate on every run"
  artefact. Empty file = full parity (target state). Non-empty =
  known drift documented in the harness PR's deferred follow-ups.
  When you ship a fix that closes a drift line, **delete that
  exact line in the same PR** — the spec asserts byte-equality so
  the snapshot update is the reviewer's signal that the fix
  landed correctly.
- Settings parity asserts only on **key presence** (every key in
  fresh `data.sql` exists post-upgrade). Values legitimately
  differ — `config.version`, per-install random keys, install
  timestamps. Don't tighten this without a concrete reason.
- The wrapper stashes + restores `web/config.php` around the run
  via a bash `trap`. The spec ALSO stashes a per-spec copy on
  top so an aborted `expect` failure inside `beforeAll` still
  recovers. Don't add extra config-mutation paths that bypass
  these stashes.
- Specs anchor on `data-testid` hooks where they exist (the v2.0
  updater chrome carries `updater-progress`, `updater-cleanup`,
  `updater-return`; the post-upgrade login goes through `login-*`).
  The 1.x panel chrome is **not** driven by these specs — the
  harness operates entirely against the v2.0 chrome served from
  the worktree. If a future slice does drive the 1.x UI (e.g.
  capturing pre-upgrade screenshots), anchor on stable id/name
  attributes the 1.x templates emit and DOCUMENT each in the
  spec.
- The harness is dev-only and **not yet a CI gate**. Run locally
  via `./sbpp.sh upgrade-e2e` before opening any PR that touches
  `web/install/`, `web/updater/`, `web/upgrade.php`, or
  `fixtures/upgrade/`. The standalone CI workflow
  (`upgrade-e2e.yml`) ships in a follow-up once the harness
  stabilises on both fixtures.
- The harness consumes `fixtures/upgrade/<v>.sql.gz` directly via
  `gunzip | mariadb`. Do NOT add a tarball-download / hash-check
  / cache layer to it — that's a separate engineering surface
  (deferred follow-up). Editing fixtures lives in
  [`fixtures/upgrade/README.md`](fixtures/upgrade/README.md).

## Anti-patterns (do NOT reintroduce)

- `xajax` / `sb-callback.php` → use the JSON API.
- ADOdb → use `Database` (PDO).
- MooTools / React / a runtime bundler → vanilla JS in `web/scripts/`.
- `web/scripts/sourcebans.js` (the v1.x ~1.7k-line bulk file shipping
  `ShowBox`, `DoLogin`, `LoadServerHost`, `selectLengthTypeReason`, …)
  → removed at v2.0.0 (#1123 D1). Page-tail helpers are inlined as
  self-contained vanilla JS per page (see `web/pages/admin.edit.ban.php`
  / `admin.edit.comms.php` for canonical examples); toasts go through
  `window.SBPP.showToast` from the theme JS.
- `openTab()` JS (and the matching `<button onclick="openTab(...)">`
  chrome on `core/admin_tabs.tpl`) → the JS handler was dropped with
  sourcebans.js at #1123 D1; the buttons did nothing and every pane
  stacked together (#1239). Sub-paged admin routes ride either
  Pattern A (`?section=…` routing — servers / mods / groups / comms
  / settings) or Pattern B (page-level ToC — admin-admins, admin-bans);
  see "Sub-paged admin routes" and "Page-level table of contents"
  conventions above.
- The horizontal `core/admin_tabs.tpl` pill strip for Pattern A
  routes → #1259 unified the chrome on the Settings-style vertical
  sidebar (`core/admin_sidebar.tpl`). New Pattern A routes (or
  changes to existing ones) build a `$sections` array with a
  Lucide `icon` per entry, pass an aria-label as the fifth
  `AdminTabs` argument, and close the sidebar shell + content
  column with `echo '</div></div>'` AFTER `Renderer::render(...)`.
  `core/admin_tabs.tpl` is now exclusively the back-link-only
  partial for edit-* pages — don't reach for it from new code.
- Inlining settings-style sidebar markup inside templates (the
  pre-#1259 shape: `<div class="grid" style="grid-template-columns:14rem 1fr">`
  followed by an inline `<nav><a class="sidebar__link">…</a></nav>`
  block in every `page_admin_settings_*.tpl`) → the sidebar is
  now single-source in `core/admin_sidebar.tpl` and mounted by
  `AdminTabs.php`. Page templates render their content column
  body and nothing else.
- New `install/` flow → DB is seeded out-of-band in dev.
- String literals for action names → `Actions.PascalName`.
- Inlining the table prefix → use `:prefix_` and let `Database` rewrite.
- `htmlspecialchars_decode` / `html_entity_decode` on JSON-API params
  (nickname, reason, chat message, …) → the JSON body is raw UTF-8. The
  xajax callbacks used to HTML-encode payloads in transit; the JSON API
  does not, and re-decoding now silently collapses literal `&amp;` and
  double-escapes on re-render (#1108). Store raw, escape on display.
- `utf8` (3-byte alias) for `DB_CHARSET` → always `utf8mb4`. 4-byte
  sequences (emoji, some CJK) otherwise trip `Incorrect string value`
  from the plugin's insert path (#1108, #765).
- Editing `install/includes/sql/data.sql` (or `struc.sql`) without a paired
  `web/updater/data/<N>.php` → upgraded installs silently miss the change.
- WYSIWYG / "rich HTML" editors (TinyMCE, CKEditor, …) for fields stored
  in `sb_settings` and rendered to other users → these fields end up
  emitted through `nofilter` and become a stored-XSS vector for every
  admin with the relevant flag (#1113). Use a plain `<textarea>` and
  pipe the value through `Sbpp\Markup\IntroRenderer` (Markdown). For
  immediate visual feedback, pair the textarea with the live preview
  pane shape from `page_admin_settings_settings.tpl` (calls
  `system.preview_intro_text`, server-renders through `IntroRenderer`).
- Ad-hoc per-page empty-state copy → use the shared `.empty-state`
  layout + the first-run-vs-filtered split documented under
  "Empty states" above. Inconsistent voice and missing CTAs are what
  #1207's empty-state audit caught; future surfaces stay on the
  unified pattern.
- Markdown-rendering admin display text client-side → use the
  server-side `system.preview_intro_text` action (same `IntroRenderer`
  the public dashboard uses). A bundled JS Markdown library would
  diverge from the safe-on-render contract.
- Unannotated `{$foo nofilter}` → every `nofilter` is an assertion the
  value is safe HTML; without a `{* nofilter: <why> *}` comment above
  it, future readers can't tell whether it's a real escape hatch or a
  copy-paste accident waiting to be exploited (#1113 audit).
- `strlen($_POST['x'])` / `trim($_POST['x'])` / `substr($row['col'], …)`
  on values that can be `null` at runtime → coalesce
  (`strlen($_POST['x'] ?? '')`) when null is "absent", or cast
  (`strlen((string) $row['col'])`) when the value should always be a
  string. PHP 8.1 deprecated this implicit null-into-scalar coercion;
  PHP 9 makes it a `TypeError` (#1273). The static gate is
  `phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules` + `phpVersion: 80200`; the
  runtime gate (for PHPStan-excluded files like `auth/openid.php`) is
  `Php82DeprecationsTest`. See "Null-into-scalar discipline" in
  Conventions for the per-shape idiom.
- `setTimeout` / `waitForTimeout` waits in E2E specs → wait on
  terminal attributes (`[data-loading="false"]` settled, `[data-skeleton]`
  removed) per #1123's "Testability hooks" rule.
- CSS class chains or visible-text *primary* selectors in E2E specs
  → use `data-testid` / ARIA roles per #1123. `hasText` filters for
  disambiguation are fine; "find element by its label text" as the
  whole selector is not.
- Hover-only row-action affordances (`.row-actions { opacity: 0 }`
  flipped to `1` on `tbody tr:hover`) → row-level Edit / Unmute /
  Remove (and equivalent) buttons must be visible by default at
  every viewport. The opacity-on-hover trick was removed from the
  comms list in #1207 ADM-5; it never worked on touch viewports
  (no hover state) and silently regressed discoverability for
  every keyboard / screen-reader user. New surfaces add visible
  buttons in the same shape as `.queue-row` (admin moderation
  queue) or the comms-list desktop table (`web/themes/default/page_comms.tpl`).
- Removing `<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no…">`
  from `core/header.tpl` (or the defensive `.drawer a[href^="tel:"]`
  reset in `theme.css`) → mobile Safari + some Android Chromes
  auto-detect colon-/digit-heavy strings like `STEAM_0:0:N`,
  `[U:1:N]`, and IPs as phone numbers and overlay a tap-to-dial
  link with the platform's accent colour (#1207 DET-1: pinkish on
  iOS dark, blueish on Android). The chrome doesn't have a single
  phone number on it; the meta is the canonical opt-out and the
  CSS reset is the belt-and-suspenders for variants that ignore it.
- Re-adding a labelled search input or a visible `Ctrl K` / `⌘K` hint
  to the topbar palette trigger (the `.topbar__search` button in
  `core/title.tpl`) → the labelled shape was a duplicate affordance
  for the same `<dialog id="palette-root">` the ⌘K shortcut already
  opens, and on mobile it broke the topbar (#1207 CC-1, slice 1) and
  on desktop it visibly competed with the palette itself (#1207 CC-3,
  slice 9). The trigger is now icon-only at every viewport, matching
  the sibling theme-toggle's chrome. The `.topbar__search-label` /
  `.topbar__search-kbd` spans stay in the DOM for SR users + the
  Mac glyph swap, but `display: none` everywhere — don't unhide them.
- Moving `<footer class="app-footer">` back outside `<div class="app">`
  (the body-level sibling shape from before #1271's structural fix) →
  `.sidebar` is `position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100vh` and its
  sticky containing block is `.app`. Pulling the footer out leaves
  `.app` `footerHeight` short of the document, so on tall pages the
  sidebar releases at the bottom (brand cuts off) and on barely-tall
  pages where `docHeight - viewport ≤ footerHeight` (the bare-e2e
  `?p=admin&c=audit` shape) the entire scroll range falls inside the
  release phase and the sidebar appears to track the scroll — exactly
  the symptom rumblefrog reported in #1271. The footer must stay as
  the last flex column item of `<div class="main">`. The
  `align-self: flex-start` on `.sidebar` (added by #1278) is
  defensive parity with `.admin-sidebar`, NOT the load-bearing fix —
  a future refactor that puts the footer back outside `.app` will
  silently regress even with `align-self` in place. The regression
  guard is `web/tests/e2e/specs/responsive/sidebar-sticky.spec.ts`'s
  strict `top===0` assertion at scroll=`document.scrollHeight`.
- Pinning `<aside id="drawer-root">` or `<dialog id="palette-root">`
  inside `<div class="app">` "to be consistent with the footer" → the
  drawer is `position: fixed; right: 0; top: 0; height: 100%`
  (right-pinned panel, NOT full-bleed — `inset: 0` is on the
  separate `.drawer-backdrop`); `<dialog>` promotes itself to the
  top layer when `showModal()`-ed. Both are conceptually top-layer
  overlays — they're not part of the app shell's layout, so they
  belong outside `.app` for the same reason a Linear/Notion modal
  isn't nested inside the page header. The defensiveness reason is
  CSS containing-block scoping: a future refactor that declares
  `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`, `contain: layout`, or
  `will-change: transform` on `.app` (or any descendant in the
  drawer's would-be ancestry) RE-ESTABLISHES THE CONTAINING BLOCK
  for `position: fixed` descendants per CSS Position Module §3.2 —
  the drawer would suddenly be positioned relative to that
  ancestor instead of the viewport, painting at the wrong size /
  in the wrong place. Keeping the drawer as a direct `<body>`
  child sidesteps that landmine. The structural-fix concern that
  motivated #1271 (sidebar's sticky CB short of the document)
  doesn't apply — `position: fixed` removes the drawer from flow,
  so it cannot grow `.app`'s height.

## Where to find what

| Need to …                              | Look at                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Understand request lifecycle           | `ARCHITECTURE.md` ("Page request lifecycle" / "JSON API request lifecycle") |
| Add a JSON action                      | `web/api/handlers/_register.php` + `web/api/handlers/<topic>.php` |
| Add or rename a permission             | `web/configs/permissions/web.json`, then regen contract  |
| Render a page                          | `web/pages/<page>.php` + `web/includes/View/*View.php`   |
| Gate compute that only feeds legacy theme-fork output (e.g. `wantsLegacyAdminCounts()`) | `web/includes/Theme.php` (`Sbpp\Theme`) — predicates page handlers ask before they pay for DTO fields the shipped default theme doesn't render. Default returns `false`; forks opt back in via `define('<flag>', true)` in their `theme.conf.php`. First user (#1270): `Sbpp\Theme::wantsLegacyAdminCounts()` keeps the 9-COUNT subquery + `getDirSize(SB_DEMOS)` walk off `web/pages/page.admin.php`'s default-theme path. New compute-paying-for-fork-only-output surfaces add a sibling `wants<X>()` predicate; the regression test in `web/tests/integration/AdminHomePerformanceTest.php` is the reference shape (resets `Sbpp\Theme::legacyComputeCount()`, asserts the gated branch did NOT fire on the default theme). |
| Edit a template                        | `web/themes/default/*.tpl`                               |
| Reuse the moderation-queue card layout (admin submissions / protests, mobile-stacked summary rows) | `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` (`.queue-row`, `.queue-row__body`, `.queue-row__date` — #1207 PUB-2). Apply by adding `class="queue-row …"` to the outer `<details>` and dropping the inline `flex` / `flex-shrink:0` styles from the summary children. |
| Add visible row actions to a table-rendered admin list (Edit / Unmute / Remove buttons + responsive mobile-card mirror) | `web/themes/default/page_comms.tpl` (#1207 ADM-5) is the canonical reference: `<button class="btn btn--secondary btn--sm">` / `<a class="btn btn--ghost btn--sm">` inside a `.row-actions` cell, plus `.ban-card__actions` row of identical-data-action buttons in the mobile card. Wire destructive / state-changing buttons via `data-action="…"` + `data-bid` + `data-fallback-href`; the inline page-tail JS calls `sb.api.call(Actions.PascalName)` and falls back to the GET URL if the JSON dispatcher is absent. |
| Edit the player-detail drawer (open trigger, tabs, panes, lazy loaders) | `web/themes/default/js/theme.js` (`renderDrawerBody` / `loadPaneIfNeeded`) |
| Edit the command palette (icon-only trigger, ⌘K binding, result rows, kbd hints, Ctrl+Enter copy) | `web/themes/default/js/theme.js` (`openPalette` / `closePalette` / `renderPaletteResults` / `applyPlatformHints` / `handlePaletteCopyShortcut`) + `core/title.tpl` (the `.topbar__search` icon button) + the `.palette__row*` rules in `web/themes/default/css/theme.css`. Player rows carry `data-drawer-bid="<bid>"` (bare Enter / click → `loadDrawer`, palette closes itself) + `data-steamid="<steam>"` (`Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` → `navigator.clipboard.writeText` + `showToast`). The kbd glyphs are server-rendered in non-Mac form (`Enter`, `Ctrl`); `applyPlatformHints` swaps `[data-enterkey]` → ⏎ and `[data-modkey]` → ⌘ on Mac/iOS at boot and after every render (#1184, #1207 DET-2). |
| Add admin-only per-player notes | `web/api/handlers/notes.php` (CRUD) — Notes tab is gated by `bans.detail`'s `notes_visible` flag |
| Render admin-authored Markdown to safe HTML | `web/includes/Markup/IntroRenderer.php` (`Sbpp\Markup`) |
| Display a user's own permission flags grouped by category | `Sbpp\View\PermissionCatalog::groupedDisplayFromMask($mask)` (`web/includes/View/PermissionCatalog.php`). Adding a new flag to `web/configs/permissions/web.json` requires a paired entry in `WEB_CATEGORIES`; `PermissionCatalogTest` enforces it. |
| Live-preview Markdown in a settings textarea | `system.preview_intro_text` JSON action + `web/themes/default/page_admin_settings_settings.tpl` (`.dash-intro-editor` / `.dash-intro-preview`) |
| Build an empty-state surface (first-run vs filtered, primary/secondary CTAs) | `.empty-state` rules in `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` + reference shapes in `page_servers.tpl`, `page_dashboard.tpl`, `page_bans.tpl`, `page_comms.tpl`, `page_admin_audit.tpl`, `page_admin_bans_protests.tpl`, `page_admin_bans_submissions.tpl` |
| Add a sticky page-level ToC to a dense admin route (anchor sidebar at desktop, accordion at mobile) | `web/themes/default/page_toc.tpl` is the parameterized shared partial (toc_id / toc_label / toc_entries — each entry carries `slug` + `label` + `icon`). The chrome is unified with Pattern A (`core/admin_sidebar.tpl`) at #1266: dual class names (`admin-sidebar page-toc`, `admin-sidebar__details page-toc__details`, …) on the partial's elements + grouped `.admin-sidebar*, .page-toc*` selectors in `theme.css` so the bare CSS lives in one place. Per-link styling comes from `.sidebar__link.admin-sidebar__link`; active state is JS-driven via an inline `IntersectionObserver` in the partial that toggles `aria-current="page"` on the matching link as the user scrolls (first link is server-rendered active so the page works without JS). The `.page-toc-shell` / `.page-toc-content` / `.page-toc-section` rules carry the cross-template content-column layout. Two reference shapes: `admin-admins` (View-driven — `AdminAdminsListView` carries the toc payload, `page_admin_admins_list.tpl` opens the shell, `page_admin_overrides.tpl` closes it) and `admin-bans` (page-handler-driven — `web/pages/admin.bans.php` opens the shell + drives the partial via `$theme->display(...)`, emits `<section id="…">` wrappers in PHP echo around each `Renderer::render(...)`). See the Conventions section "Page-level table of contents (dense admin pages)" (#1207 ADM-3, #1239, #1266). |
| Subdivide an admin route into `?section=<slug>` URLs (servers, mods, groups, comms, settings) | `web/pages/admin.settings.php` is the long-standing reference; #1239 brought servers / mods / groups / comms onto the same shape; #1259 unified the chrome on the Settings-style vertical sidebar. The shared partial is `web/themes/default/core/admin_sidebar.tpl` (parameterized on `tabs` / `active_tab` / `sidebar_id` / `sidebar_label`); `web/includes/AdminTabs.php` opens `<div class="admin-sidebar-shell">`, emits the `<aside>` + link list, opens `<div class="admin-sidebar-content">`, and the page handler closes both wrappers (`echo '</div></div>'`) AFTER `Renderer::render(...)`. Each `$sections` entry carries `slug` + `name` + `permission` + `url` + `icon` (Lucide name); the link emits `<a href="?p=admin&c=<page>&section=<slug>" data-testid="admin-tab-<slug>" aria-current="page">` — never `<button onclick="openTab(...)">` (the JS handler was deleted at #1123 D1). See "Sub-paged admin routes" in Conventions. |
| Lay out a sub-paged admin route's chrome (the 14rem vertical sidebar at `>=1024px`, the `<details open>` accordion at `<1024px`) | `web/themes/default/core/admin_sidebar.tpl` (the partial) + the `.admin-sidebar-shell` / `.admin-sidebar` / `.admin-sidebar__details` / `.admin-sidebar__summary` / `.admin-sidebar__nav` / `.admin-sidebar__link` / `.admin-sidebar-content` rules in `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` (#1259). The active link reuses the shared `.sidebar__link[aria-current="page"]` rule from the main app shell so the dark-pill-in-light / brand-orange-in-dark treatment is single-source. |
| Render the trailing "Back" link on edit-* admin pages (the only surface that calls `new AdminTabs([], …)`) | `web/themes/default/core/admin_tabs.tpl` is the back-link-only partial (it still has a defensive `{foreach}` for legacy themes, but `AdminTabs.php` only routes here when `$tabs === []`). Page handlers like `admin.edit.ban.php` / `admin.rcon.php` / `admin.email.php` call `new AdminTabs([], $userbank, $theme)` and the partial emits the right-aligned Back anchor (`.admin-tabs__back` in theme.css). |
| Add or rename an admin-admins advanced-search filter | `web/pages/admin.admins.php` (filter-building loop + active-filter map for pagination) + `web/pages/admin.admins.search.php` (DTO population) + `web/includes/View/AdminAdminsSearchView.php` (`active_filter_*` properties) + `web/themes/default/box_admin_admins_search.tpl` (input + pre-fill). The form is single-submit AND-semantics with a backward-compat shim for legacy `advType=…&advSearch=…` URLs (#1207 ADM-4); cover new filters in `web/tests/integration/AdminAdminsSearchTest.php`. |
| Add a shared "1 of these required" badge for an either/or input pair | `web/themes/default/page_submitban.tpl` (`data-required-group="…"` + the inline guard script — vanilla JS `// @ts-check`, blocks submit when both are empty) |
| Bootstrap (paths, autoload, theme)     | `web/init.php`                                           |
| Routing (`?p=…&c=…&o=…`)               | `web/includes/page-builder.php` — unrecognised admin `c=…` returns the 404 page slot via `web/pages/page.404.php` + `Sbpp\View\NotFoundView` (#1207 ADM-1) |
| Resolve the panel version (`SB_VERSION`, `data-version="…"` footer hook) | `web/includes/Version.php` (`Sbpp\Version::resolve()`) — three-tier fallback: `configs/version.json` → `git describe` → the `'dev'` sentinel (#1207 CC-5) |
| Auth / JWT cookie                      | `web/includes/auth/`                                     |
| CSRF                                   | `web/includes/security/CSRF.php`                         |
| Schema                                 | `web/install/includes/sql/struc.sql`                     |
| Seed `sb_settings` rows for fresh installs | `web/install/includes/sql/data.sql`                  |
| Add a one-off DB upgrade for existing installs | `web/updater/data/<N>.php` + `web/updater/store.json` |
| Pull a 1.x snapshot fixture for the v2.0.0 upgrade dry-run | `fixtures/upgrade/<version>.sql.gz` + `fixtures/upgrade/config.<version>.php` (matching pre-rendered config.php with redacted secrets) + `fixtures/upgrade/capture/capture.sh` (re-runnable orchestrator that pulls the release tarball, loads `install/includes/sql/struc.sql` + `data.sql`, seeds 5000 bans / 200 admins / 30 servers / 50 protests / 500 comms with 4-byte UTF-8 names per #1108 via `seed.php` in an ephemeral `php:8.2-cli` container, dumps + gzips). Snapshots live OUTSIDE `web/` so they never ship in the release tarball. See `fixtures/upgrade/README.md` for the operator-grade walkthrough (#1166). |
| Drive the v1.x → v2.0 upgrade end-to-end with parity assertions | `web/tests/e2e/specs/upgrade/` (#1269). Wrapper: `./sbpp.sh upgrade-e2e [--grep …]`. Each fixture gets its own spec (`upgrade-1.7.0.spec.ts`, …) tagged `@upgrade`. Helpers under `_helpers/` (`upgradeFlow.ts` drives `/upgrade.php` + `/updater/index.php`; `upgradeDb.ts` bridges the PHP CLI driver `_helpers/scripts/upgrade-db.php`; `parity.ts` does pure-string schema/settings diffs; `copyFixture.ts` stashes `config.php`). Schema-parity baseline at `__snapshots__/<version>/schema.diff` (empty = full parity; non-empty = locked known drift, delete a line in the same PR as the migration fix that closes it). Throwaway DBs are `sourcebans_upgrade_*` (the PHP driver refuses any other name). NOT in CI yet — runs locally before any PR touching `web/install/`, `web/updater/`, `web/upgrade.php`, or `fixtures/upgrade/`. See "Upgrade harness" under Conventions. |
| Test fixtures                          | `web/tests/Fixture.php`, `web/tests/ApiTestCase.php`     |
| Populate the dev DB with realistic synthetic data (banlist > 1 page, drawer history, moderation queues, audit log) | `./sbpp.sh db-seed` → `web/tests/scripts/seed-dev-db.php` (CLI driver) → `web/tests/Synthesizer.php` (`Sbpp\Tests\Synthesizer`). Dev-only: refuses any `DB_NAME` other than `sourcebans` (so `sourcebans_test` / `sourcebans_e2e` stay untouched). Idempotent; deterministic given a fixed `--seed` (default `Synthesizer::DEFAULT_SEED`). Does NOT share plumbing with `Fixture::truncateAndReseed` — the e2e hot path stays minimal. |
| API wire-format snapshots              | `web/tests/api/__snapshots__/<topic>/<scenario>.json`    |
| Action -> permission lock              | `web/tests/api/PermissionMatrixTest.php`                 |
| Trap PHP 8.1 null-into-scalar deprecations at runtime (the bits PHPStan can't see) | `web/tests/integration/Php82DeprecationsTest.php` (#1273) — process-isolated render harness with a stub Smarty + `set_error_handler` that promotes `E_DEPRECATED` / `E_USER_DEPRECATED` to `\ErrorException`. Mirrors the LostPasswordChromeTest stub-Smarty pattern; each test method runs in a separate process because the page handlers declare top-level helpers (`setPostKey()` etc.) that PHP can't redeclare in one process. Add a marquee route here whenever a new high-traffic page handler ships, especially if it reads nullable `:prefix_*` columns or `$_POST` / `$_GET` lookups. |
| Add an E2E spec                        | `web/tests/e2e/specs/<smoke|flows|a11y|responsive>/...` + `web/tests/e2e/pages/...` |
| Add a route to the screenshot gallery  | `web/tests/e2e/specs/_screenshots.spec.ts` (`ROUTES` array) |
| Tweak mobile (<=768px) chrome layout   | `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` — see the `#1207` `@media (max-width: 768px)` blocks for the canonical shapes (icon-only topbar search, full-width drawer + scroll lock). Sub-paged admin routes (servers / mods / groups / settings) use the `<details open>` accordion in the `#1259` `@media (min-width: 1024px)` block (sidebar inline at `<1024px`, sticky 14rem rail at `>=1024px`); see "Sub-paged admin routes" in Conventions. |
| Stop mobile browsers auto-linking SteamIDs / IPs as phone numbers | `web/themes/default/core/header.tpl` (`<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no…">` + `<meta name="x-apple-data-detectors">`) and the defensive `.drawer a[href^="tel:"]` reset in `theme.css` |
| Lock page scroll while a modal-style chrome is open | `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` (`html:has(#drawer-root[data-drawer-open="true"]) { overflow: hidden; }` — pure-CSS, gates on the same `data-drawer-open` mirror theme.js sets, applies at every viewport so the drawer-open contract is symmetric desktop/mobile per the Linear/Vercel/Notion modal idiom) |
| Keep the main sidebar sticky-pinned across the full document scroll (`<aside class="sidebar">`) | The structural half of #1271 lives in `web/themes/default/core/footer.tpl`: `<footer class="app-footer">` is rendered as the LAST flex column item of `<div class="main">`, INSIDE `<div class="app">`. `.sidebar`'s sticky containing block is `.app`; if the footer were a body-level sibling of `.app` (the pre-fix shape), `.app`'s height would fall short of the document by `footerHeight` and the sidebar would release at the bottom — brand cut off, on barely-tall pages (`docHeight - viewport ≤ footerHeight`, e.g. `?p=admin&c=audit` on the bare e2e seed) the entire scroll range would be in the release phase and the sidebar would track the scroll. Keeping the footer inside `.app` makes the sticky CB extend to the full document. The CSS half (`.sidebar { align-self: flex-start; }` from #1278) is defensive parity with `.admin-sidebar` and is RETAINED but not load-bearing on its own. The footer's `margin-top: auto` (`.app-footer` rule in `theme.css`) is the classic "sticky footer" pattern — pushes the footer to the bottom of `.main`'s flex column on short pages so the credit doesn't float halfway up the viewport. Regression guard: `web/tests/e2e/specs/responsive/sidebar-sticky.spec.ts` asserts strict `top===0` at scroll=`document.scrollHeight` on `?p=admin&c=bans` (the canonical tall page) AND on `?p=admin&c=audit` (the barely-tall page that historically presented the bug most visibly). |
| Disable the chrome's slide-in / fade animations for `prefers-reduced-motion` users | `web/themes/default/css/theme.css` (`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` global block — see the matching note in "Playwright E2E specifics" / Conventions) |
| Run a stack in parallel with another worktree | Worktree-local `docker-compose.override.yml` (see "Parallel stacks") |
| Local dev stack details                | `docker/README.md`                                       |
